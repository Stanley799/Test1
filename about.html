<p>Stalozran is a company that deals in solving problems with great masterpieces. We not only believe that art can make our surrounding beautiful, but we also believe that it can act as great utility to the society. For instance, art can play a therapeutic purpose in our lives today. For many years, many people have found solace in their hearts by looking at artworks or taking part in one. As an organization and a community at large, we aim at producing efficient products to all and sundry hence we will not relent.</p>
<p> The company is owned by Stanley Otieno Oduor, who has been a passionate artist who has a wide interest in all artistic fields (drawing, painting, sculpting, designing of outfits, poetry, dance etc).</p>  
  <p>It started as a smaller business than it is, and everything was run by a single person. With time the company grew and started producing multiple products such as paintings, drawings, outfits, wall hangings and many decorations. </p>
<p>This is a company that sells beautiful artworks of any kind.</p>
